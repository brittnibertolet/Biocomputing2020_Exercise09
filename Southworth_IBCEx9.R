# Exercise 9

# Start small and work up

# Read data from a file, calculate the coefficient of variation (std dev divided by mean)
  # for a user-specified column
# If <50 observations (<50 rows in specified column), report an error warning that can be overriden by user
# Also consider, what the function should do if the data includes NAs
# So, do step 1, then add in <50 error warning, then data with NAs
# Return coefficients as a vector

# Then, do this for each file in a specified directory
# Directory name is an argument called 'dir', plus any other arguments needed for the task

# 1. Create some fake data with >50 rows, no NAs 
# 2. Code to read the data file into R
# 3. Function to calculate coefficient of variation for a specified column
# 4. Create some fake data with <50 rows (and read it into the code from 2 & 3)
# 5. Tell R to give an error if <50 rows, but allow this error to be overriden with user input
# 6. Create fake data with NAs (<50 and <50 rows) -- see what happens in R
  # then troubleshoot and figure out how to correct it
